#Number Plate Detection

Begin by cloning this repository into a new directory or folder using Git.
Execute the prerequisite code by running 'prerequisites.py'.
To detect number plates during the day, run 'day_detection.py'. For night-time plate detection, use 'night_detection.py'.
If the functionality is no longer required, execute the 'uninstall.py' script to remove it.

Thank you.
